# 1

## 1.1(5/5)

## 1.2(3/5)

According to the definitions, `TOTAL_DEATHS` is the **Total Number of Deaths from the Earthquake and secondary effects**. According to the problem description, you should use `DEATHS`.

## 1.3(10/10)

You will lose these points which value is zero.

## 1.4(10/10)

The same largest earthquake could happen on more than one date.

# 2(9/10)

Try to avoid using for loop, you can use `mutate(new_data = substr(data,1,3))` instead.  R will handle the parallel computing for you.

# 3(9/10)

The same problem as 2.
